### Included:
  - Python Machine learning Model
  - Tableau
  - csv file (Fantasy Football Player Data)
  - Power Point Presentation
  - Timeline
  
 
## The objective
To create a machine learning model using python that correclty predicts the overall "ftps" of each player when given the variables. In Tabeau I have provided visual demonstration of interestings ideas and facts as well as impacts of individual variables on the final target.  

## Methodology and Process
 - The process was to start with an MVP model. I wanted the basic model so that I could apply my tactics individually. I was surprised that the model was overfitting at first producing a model well of 99%. I was quick to remove columns such as salary, and ID. 
 - The columns were mostly evenly distributed so there no tranformations necesary. I did check for zeros and some columns suchs ass passing yards, and receiving yards needed to be dropped with over 95% zeros.
 - Once I was done cleaning I began running my other models such as KNN and Random Forest models.


## Python Machine Learning
### Clean and analyze data from Fantasy Football player data from 2014-2021 and 
Develop the optimum regression model to predict target (FPTS):

#### Conclusion
 - The data was mostly clean. Random Forest using hyperparameter tuning was the best score at 98%. 
 - A
 gain rushing yards could have been Removed
 - Money Talks
 - A RANKING SYSTEM CAN be developed using salary alone for a fantasy draft
 - I will be testing this season, Wish me Luck!


 
## Tableau 
### Further Analayze the player data and the impact each variable has on the final target, example (effect of "salary" and "total fpts")
 - Salary Heavily Impacts the players Fantasy Points Year over Year
 - WIDE RECIEVERS Are the Highest Scorers
 - Yards and Touchdowns mean nothing to the model
 - New Englad has the most Players with Fantasy Points

 * Could have Removed Rushing yards.
