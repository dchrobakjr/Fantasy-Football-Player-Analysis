# Final Regression Analysis Project: 
### Included:
  - Python Machine learning Model
  - Tableau
  - csv file (Fantasy Football Player Data)
  - Power Point Presentation
  - Timeline
  
 
## The objective
To create a machine learning model using python that correclty predicts the overall "ftps" of each player when given the variables. In Tabeau I have provided visual demonstration of interestings ideas and facts as well as impacts of individual variables on the final target.  

## Methodology and Process
 - 



  
## Python Machine Learning
### Clean and analyze data from Fantasy Football player data from 2014-2021 and 
Develop the optimum regression model to predict target (FPTS):
 - Linear Regression -
 - KNN -
 - Random Forest - 
#### Conclusion
 - 

 
## Tableau 
### Further Analayze the player data and the impact each variable has on the final target, example (effect of "salary" and "total fpts")

# Power Point Presentaion
###  There is also is a presentation of the data gathered and its real world applictability provided
